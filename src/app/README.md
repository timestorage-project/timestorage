# App Module

This directory, `src/app/`, appears to be a distinct module or component within the TimeStorage project.

## Observed Structure

-   **`src/app/src/`**: This nested source directory contains further subdirectories.
    -   **`src/app/src/declarations/`**: The presence of a `declarations` subdirectory here strongly suggests that this `app` module might define its own Internet Computer canisters or interact with existing ones. `declarations` directories typically hold Candid interface files (`.did`) and auto-generated client bindings (JavaScript/TypeScript) for canisters.

## Potential Purpose & Technology Stack

The exact purpose and technology stack of the `app` module are not fully determined from the current information. However, based on the `declarations` subdirectory, it could be:

1.  **A Separate Canister or Group of Canisters**: This module might house the source code (e.g., Motoko `.mo` files or Rust `Cargo.toml` and `.rs` files, likely within `src/app/src/`) for one or more canisters with specific functionalities.
2.  **A Shared Library with Canister Interactions**: It could be a library or utility module that itself interacts with canisters and provides an abstraction layer for other parts of the project.
3.  **A Sub-Application**: It might represent a smaller, self-contained application or service that is part of the larger TimeStorage ecosystem.

To determine the precise technology stack (e.g., Motoko, Rust for canisters, or if it's a frontend component), a deeper inspection of the files within `src/app/src/` (besides `declarations`) would be necessary.

## Integration

How this `app` module integrates with other parts of the TimeStorage project (like `timestorage_backend`, `timestorage_frontend`, etc.) would depend on its specific role. If it's a canister, other components might call its methods. If it's a library, it might be imported by other canisters or frontends.

**Note**: This README provides a high-level overview based on directory structure. For detailed information, the source files within `src/app/src/` should be examined.
